## Included Skills

### Claude Code & Antigravity Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **vibe-builder** | Solo Builder agent — builds complete applications from scratch using 6-phase Agentic Coding workflow with deep research, PRD creation, autonomous coding, testing, and human-in-the-loop checkpoints. |
| **vibe-debugger** | Structured debugging workflow — researches bugs, writes a BUG_REPORT.md with root cause analysis and proposed fixes, asks for human review, implements the fix, and verifies it. |

### Vibe Builder Features

The `vibe-builder` skill is a comprehensive Solo Builder agent that:

**6-Phase Workflow:**
1. **Research & Product Spec** — Deep web research (5-8 searches), creates PRD.md with wireframes, flowcharts, ER diagrams
2. **Planning & Review** — Human reviews PRD, agent updates CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md with project summary
3. **Agentic Coding** — Fully autonomous coding with context sync every 3-5 tasks
4. **Testing Setup** — Creates TEST_PLAN.md, stops for human review
5. **Testing Execution** — Autonomous test execution with auto-fix loop
6. **Fine-tune & Loop** — Iterative refinement based on human feedback

**Key Features:**
- **Context Recovery** — Hooks for Claude Code to recover workflow after context compaction
- **Docker-First** — Prioritizes Docker images for infrastructure (postgres, redis, supabase, etc.)
- **Typed Languages** — Enforces TypeScript, Rust, or Python with type hints
- **Human Checkpoints** — Mandatory stops at Phase 1, 2, and 4 for human approval
- **Self-Setup** — Agent sets up everything (Docker, dependencies, configs) autonomously

**Usage:**
```
/vibe-builder <describe the app you want to build>
```

## How It Works

The installer downloads the latest kit from GitHub and copies the selected skills/agents into your project's `.claude/` and `.agent/` directories. It only warns about individual files that would be overwritten — it won't touch your existing config.

## Project Guide

If you want the overall operating reference for this repo, read `AI_CODING_WIKI_GUIDE.md` first. It summarizes the source-of-truth model, sync policy, search direction, and how `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` fit together.

If you want the current priority ordering for what to do next, read `PROJECT_PRIORITY_PLAN.md` after that.

## Contributing

To add a new skill or agent:
